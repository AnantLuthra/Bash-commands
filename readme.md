- **Knowing about commands**
  - `whatis command` - Get a one-line description of the command.
  - `apropos keyword` - Search command related to keyword you have provided.
  - `man command` - Get the manual of the command. It is like documentation of some command. Some commands may not have manual.
  - `info command` - Get the info of the command. It is like documentation of some command. Some commands may not have info. Works same as `man` command.

- **Working with files and directories**
  - `mkdir directoryname1 directoryname2` - Create directories, you can provide multiple directories, or you can create directories one by one.
  - `touch filename` - Create a file, if file already exists then it will update the timestamp of the file, more files can be created at once also like `mkdir` command.
  - `cp filename1 filename2` - Copy the file from filename1 to filename2. If filename2 is a directory then it will copy the file to that directory.
    - Example - `cp â€”/.bashrc bashrc` - Copy the file `.bashrc` to the file `bashrc`.
  - **Note** - If you press tab to auto-complete the filename, then if it does it means file exists.. so inclusively it is working like `ls` command.
